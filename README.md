# AdventOfCode

A repository for all of my Advent Of Code needs. Every year, every programming language that I've done.
You can also create your own fork from this project as a template for your own. I'll be updating this as I solve more problems, 
or create new solutions to old ones in either Python or whatever other language I decide to use.

Feel free to create your own branch for your own personal use!

## Python Solutions

Python solutions are fun from the root. So running them from command line would look something like

python python/2015/day01.py

This is just because I run them from the Python: Run Python File from Terminal in VSCode from the root.

## J Solutions

I use a J extension in VSCode that allows me to load and display the scripts, again from the root.

## Rust Solutions

The rust directory is a cargo project. Just move into the rust directory from the command line and do cargo run.

I'll be adding command line parameters for different days of course.
